# AWS Image Analysis Pipeline (Textract, Comprehend, Bedrock)

This repository documents a learning project that explores multiple AWS AI services 
to analyze images, extract text, and generate summaries.

The project evolves through three stages:

1. **OCR using Amazon Textract**  
2. **Text summarization and sentiment analysis using Amazon Comprehend**  
3. **Image understanding using Amazon Bedrock (Claude 3)**  

---

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to understand how different AWS AI services can be combined 
to process images and extract meaningful insights. The workflow progresses from traditional 
OCR-based extraction to foundation-model-based image understanding.

## Processing Flow

### Version 1 – OCR with Amazon Textract
- **Input:** JPG / PNG images  
- **Service used:** Amazon Textract  
- **Output:** Extracted text saved as `.txt` files  

### Version 2 – OCR + NLP Analysis
- **OCR:** Amazon Textract  
- **Text analysis:** Amazon Comprehend  
- **Output:**  
  - Extracted text  
  - Key phrases  
  - Sentiment classification  

### Version 3 – Image Understanding with Amazon Bedrock
- **Input:** Image sent directly to a foundation model  
- **Model used:** Anthropic Claude 3 (via Bedrock)  
- **Output:** Natural language explanation of image content

## AWS Setup (Console Steps)

The following AWS services were enabled using the AWS Management Console for this learning project:

| Service | API / Model | IAM Policy | Notes |
|---------|------------|------------|-------|
| Amazon Textract | DetectDocumentText | FullAccess | For learning purposes |
| Amazon Comprehend | DetectKeyPhrases, DetectSentiment | FullAccess | Language: English |
| Amazon Bedrock | Claude 3 Haiku via Bedrock | FullAccess | Requests made using `bedrock-runtime` |

**Notes:**  
- Full access policies were used to simplify experimentation.  
- For production or sensitive projects, always follow the principle of least privilege.  
- No credentials, account IDs, or sensitive information are included in this repository.

## Sample Outputs

Below are example outputs generated by the scripts.  
Screenshots are included for demonstration only. No sensitive or billable information is shown.
