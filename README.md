# AWS Image Analysis Pipeline (Textract, Comprehend, Bedrock)

This repository documents a learning project that explores multiple AWS AI services to analyze images, extract text, and generate summaries.

The project evolves through three stages:
1. OCR using Amazon Textract
2. Text summarization and sentiment analysis using Amazon Comprehend
3. Image understanding using Amazon Bedrock (Claude 3)

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to understand how different AWS AI services can be
combined to process images and extract meaningful insights.

The workflow progresses from traditional OCR-based extraction to
foundation-model-based image understanding.

## Processing Flow

### Version 1 – OCR with Amazon Textract
- Input: JPG / PNG images
- Service used: Amazon Textract
- Output: Extracted text saved as `.txt`

### Version 2 – OCR + NLP Analysis
- OCR: Amazon Textract
- Text analysis: Amazon Comprehend
- Output:
  - Extracted text
  - Key phrases
  - Sentiment classification

### Version 3 – Image Understanding with Amazon Bedrock
- Input image is sent directly to a foundation model
- Model used: Anthropic Claude 3 (via Bedrock)
- Output: Natural language explanation of image content
## AWS Setup (Console Steps)

The following AWS services were enabled using the AWS Management Console for this learning project:

### 1. Amazon Textract
- Service enabled from AWS Console
- API used: `DetectDocumentText`
- IAM policy: **FullAccess** (for learning purposes)

### 2. Amazon Comprehend
- Used for key phrase extraction and sentiment analysis
- Language: English (`en`)
- IAM policy: **FullAccess** (for learning purposes)

### 3. Amazon Bedrock
- Model used: Anthropic Claude 3 Haiku via Bedrock
- Requests made using `bedrock-runtime`
- IAM policy: **FullAccess** (for learning purposes)

**Notes:**
- Full access policies were used to simplify experimentation.
- For production or sensitive projects, always follow the principle of least privilege.
- No credentials, account IDs, or sensitive information are included in this repository.
